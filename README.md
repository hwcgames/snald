# SNALD

spooky door-controllin' vent-patrollin' game in Godot

## Spoilers

There are secrets in the game, so if you decide to peruse this source code you should treat anything you find as a potential spoiler.

## Usage

Change [snald_folder.tres](snald_folder.tres)'s `trenchbroom_games_folder` to suit your Trenchbroom installation, then select `snald_folder.tres` in Godot's filesystem pane and check the first "Export File" box in the Inspector. This will generate a Trenchbroom game definition for SNALD.

Take care not to change `snald_folder.tres` in the editor, it is ignored by version control to allow you to set the export path.

## Controls

As controls are currently remappable, however, you can use the following keys/buttons to control the game by default:

* Left and right on the arrow keys, d-pad, or left stick to turn
* Down on the arrow keys, d-pad, or left stick to open the map
* Right stick to move virtual pointer on the map
* Right trigger to click with the virtual pointer
* A and B on the controller or Z and X on the keyboard to perform the primary and secondary actions as marked on the screen* A and B on the controller or Z and X on the keyboard to perform the primary and secondary actions as marked on the screen

## Polaris' log:

Hey all, Lucas here, This is a funny remake of a game I made on scratch in 2015:

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/41602276/

My coding friend, Willow, decided it would be funny if she used her skills to remake the game.
After alot of jank and sacrifice we have finally made something playable, her first complete game project too.
She was totally right about it being funny.
