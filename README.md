# SNALD

spooky door-controllin' vent-patrollin' game in Godot

## Spoilers

There are secrets in the game, so if you decide to peruse this source code you should treat anything you find as a potential spoiler.

## Usage

Change [snald_folder.tres](snald_folder.tres)'s `trenchbroom_games_folder` to suit your Trenchbroom installation, then select `snald_folder.tres` in Godot's filesystem pane and check the first "Export File" box in the Inspector. This will generate a Trenchbroom game definition for SNALD.

Take care not to change `snald_folder.tres` in the editor, it is ignored by version control to allow you to set the export path.
