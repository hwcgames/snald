# SNALD Modding Book

*(This book is a work-in-progress, so don't take it too seriously yet)*

This book documents SNALD's engine features and guides you through getting started with your mod. It's recommended that you already know a little about programming and the Godot game engine.

## Licensing

When making a new game based on SNALD's code, or making a mod which includes significant portions of SNALD's code, you must comply with the terms of the MPL2.0 under which the SNALD source code is distributed. See [TLDRLegal](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mozilla-public-license-2-0-mpl-2) for a non-binding summary of your rights and restrictions. Mods or games based on SNALD must not include any of SNALD's original music or art assets.

We would prefer if you paid for SNALD when using its code for a mod or new game, but you have the right to use it for free.

## Special features for Linux and MacOS

SNALD's development and build automation happen on a Linux system, so we include scripts to make setup easy there. They'll probably require some modification to work on MacOS, but if you're willing to do some digging they should work. When something can be done easily with a helper script, you'll see a notice like this:

> *On Linux,* you can run `foo.sh` to accomplish bar more easily.
