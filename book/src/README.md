# SNALD Modding Book

*(This book is a work-in-progress, so don't take it too seriously yet)*

## Special features for Linux and MacOS

SNALD's development and build automation happen on a Linux system, so we include scripts to make setup easy there. They'll probably require some modification to work on MacOS, but if you're willing to do some digging they should work. When something can be done easily with a helper script, you'll see a notice like this:

```admonish tip
On Linux, you can run `foo.sh` to accomplish bar more easily.
